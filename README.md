- ðŸ“Œ Hi, Iâ€™m @cmucsacademy. You can call me CM or Caspian though. 

I'm a queer teen (they/bug/xe) here because my programming class was not designed for students that actually enjoy coding. Planning on making stupid shit with friends and hopefully learning more while I'm at it!

- ðŸ’» learning java
- ðŸ’» know some python
- ðŸ’» know some HTML
