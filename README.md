- ðŸ“Œ Hi, Iâ€™m @cmucsacademy. You can call me CM or NAME though. 

I'm a queer teenager (they/bug/xe) here because my programming class was not designed for students that actually enjoy coding (thanks Mr. Fox!). Planning on making stupid shit with friends and hopefully learning more while I'm at it!

- ðŸ’» I'm learning python, know a little HTTML, and would like to learn Java
